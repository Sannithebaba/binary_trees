Binary trees

This project is all about binary tree in C. It is a tree data structure in which node has at most two children, which are refered to as the left child and the right child. first task - Write a function that creates a binary tree node second task - Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node third task - Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node fouth task - Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree fifth task - Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf sixth task - Write a function that checks if a given node is a root seventh task - Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal eight task - Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
